# Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)

An improved Whale Optimization Algorithm for grape leaf disease classification.

## Overview

This project presents an enhanced version of the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for classifying grape leaf diseases. WOA, introduced by Mirjalili and Lewis in 2016, is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that simulates the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales. This repository demonstrates its application in plant disease detection, optimizing classification accuracy through iterative evaluation.

## Demo

The project visualizes the performance of each whale during optimization:
