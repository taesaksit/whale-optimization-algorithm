# Whale Optimization Algorithm

An enhanced Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for grape leaf disease classification.

## Overview

This project presents an improvement on the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for the classification of grape leaf diseases. WOA, introduced by Mirjalili and Levis in 2016, is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that mimics the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales. This repository demonstrates its application in plant disease detection.
